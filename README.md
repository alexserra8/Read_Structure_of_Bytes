# Read_Structure_of_Bytes

In this repository it is shown a way to transform data in binary format (bytes), to readable data format.

We have two codes:

**Read_Bytes**: in this code it is shown how to read data from bytes. It's important to highlight that we should know the basic information of the binary file, like: length of frames, type of data (float, bool,..) and his order. In this code, we just obtain and print the obtained values for an academic/testing purpose. It can be tested with the binary file provided: *TestFile_2.bin*.


**Bytes_to_DataFrame**: this code is an example of how to apply the Read_Bytes codes to obtain a dataframe. It can be tested with the binary file provided: *TestFile_2.bin*.
