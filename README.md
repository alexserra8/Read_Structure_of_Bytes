# Read_Structure_of_Bytes
In this repository is show how to transform data from bytes, to readable data format.

As an input, we have binary file. Of course, we have to know which is the structure of the binary file like: length of frames, type of data (float, bool,..) and his order.

As an output, we can transform this binary data in a readable format. The "main" just print the values obtaineed, but it can be changed. Depending on your needs, you can create some structure that will output dataframe (like in Bytes_to_DataFrame code)
